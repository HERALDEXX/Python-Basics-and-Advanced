# Arithmetic Operators:
addition = 2 + 47
subtraction = 89 - 23
multiplication = 3 * 6
division = 45 / 5
modulus = 10 % 3
exponentitation = 2 ** 3
floor_division = 10 //4
print(modulus) # ==> Returns the remainder value after the division
print(floor_division) # ==> Returns the integer part ot the quotient (result)


# Assignment Operators:
num = 2
num += 4
print(num) # +=

# -=
# *=
# /=
# %=
# //=
# **=
